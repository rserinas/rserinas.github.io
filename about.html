                    <h2>His Humble Beginnings</h2>
                    <p>Atty. Matula was born to Mr. Carlos Matula, Sr. and Mrs. Basilia Gito Matula in 1965. His father was a landless farmer and his mother was a dressmaker. He is the eldest of 9 siblings, 1 of whom died in infancy.  Their family originally lived in Sultan sa Barongis, Maguindanao (formerly part of Cotabato) when the fratricidal war between “Muslims and Christians” broke out that forced them to evacuate to a safer place in Loreto, Agusan del Sur where he grew up.</p>
                    <p>He graduated valedictorian at the Loreto Central Elementary School. His pursuit for higher education, prodded him to move to Butuan City where he worked as a newsboy to sustain his secondary education at the Agusan National High School. He worked also as a plantation worker at the Valentina G. Plaza Rubber Plantation in upper Agusan during summers. He graduated in 1982 and was recognized as one of the Outstanding Boy Scouts and CAT cadet officer in his batch.  He obtained a scholarship from the Mindanao State University (MSU) where  he finished  his Bachelor of Arts in Political Science.</p>
                    <p>He took the entrance exams at the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) and passed the theoretical exams but failed to make it in the final screening.  He proceeded to take the entrance exams at the MSU College of Law and landed in the top ten which qualified him for a scholarship. He initially enrolled in the College of Law in 1987. The following year, he was invited by Rev. Fr. Romeo Intengan, SJ to do translation work of the social democratic documents as well some Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) campaign materials from English to Visayan at the La Ignaciana Apostolic Center in Santa Ana, Manila.

He successfully hurdled the bar in 1998.  After taking his oath as a lawyer, he left his post at the Social Security Commission (SSC) and went back to FFW and started serving as a legal counsel for the workers, a dream he always had in his heart since he was young.</p>
